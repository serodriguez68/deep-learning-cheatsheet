# Overview

This cheat sheet covers all of the __coding, intuition and application__ aspects of the foundational deep learning concepts. 
This works assumes that you know the basics of neural networks, and it is intended to be a quick
reference on how to use them using Python libraries.

This cheat sheet does not explain the mathematical grounding behind deep learning (but does give some intuition).

The work is based on a mixture of different resources. Notably: 
- Kirill Eremenko's and Hadelin de Ponteve's 
[Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) course
on Udemy. 
    - Note that the cheat sheet is not intended to be a replacement for the course.
- The University of Melbourne's Postgraduate course on [Statistical Machine Learning](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp90051).
